optic_planner provides two ROS2 packages: a version of the [OPTIC planner](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/planning/software/optic.html) that builds within a [ROS2](https://github.com/ros2) workspace, and a [PlanSys2](https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/ros2_planning_system) plugin to run the OPTIC planner within PlanSys2.
