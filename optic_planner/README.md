# `King's College London OPTIC Planner`

This is a version of the KCL OPTIC Planner designed to be built as part of a ROS 2 workspace.

Information about the original planner, including academic literature and original source code, can be found at
KCL's [website for the planner](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/planning/software/optic.html).

Some changes to modernize the source code for compilation by modern compilers was taken from the
[roveri-marco version](https://github.com/roveri-marco/optic) on GitHub.

Finally, the ROS version of the [KCL popf planner](https://github.com/fmrico/popf/tree/foxy-devel), also on GitHub,
served as an example for creating a ROS package out of a legacy planner.
